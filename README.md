# brew_crew

Completed project following the tutorial series by [The Net Ninja](https://github.com/iamshaunjp) on [building an app using Flutter and Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC), updated to Q2 2023.

# Specifications

This project makes use of Flutter SDK `3.10.6`, and was tested on a `Pixel 6` using `Android 13.0 Tiramisu` emulated with Android Studio `2022.1.20`. Instead of configuring Firebase in Flutter as done in the tutorials, I used the [Firebase CLI tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android). I used a Windows 10 machine and had to enable developer mode on my machine.

# Setup

1. Clone this project. (*IMPORTANT*: the directory containing all code in this project should be named `brew_crew`.)
2. Open a command line on the same level as the project.
3. Run `flutter pub get`.
4. Run `flutterfire configure --project=<enter your project name>`, and select your platform (enter selects all).
